# 📊 India's GDP - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my first published data science project on GitHub!  
This notebook presents a **complete exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of India's GDP, per capita income, and percentage growth from past decades. It covers data cleaning, outlier handling, visualizations, and statistical insights using Python.

## 🧠 Motivation

As a young data scientist and passionate learner, this is my **first official EDA project** that I’ve decided to share with the world. The goal was to:
- Understand how India’s economy has evolved over time
- Practice core EDA skills in pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and NumPy
- Apply statistical concepts like the **Central Limit Theorem**, IQR, and KDE
- Showcase my work to the data science community
